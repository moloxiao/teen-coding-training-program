# teen-coding-training-program
This a teen coding training program. The entire project is currently led by Nathaniel, and Shan is responsible for the preparation of the coding part. We are still in the discussion phase.  
The main objective at this stage is: **To select the training program** .  

We will achieve this objective through the following steps: 
1. Organize several possible cases;
2. Discuss and establish evaluation criteria;
3. Select the training program.

After completing this stage, the plan for the next stage is to **finish the preparation for teaching the selected courses**.  


## case1 : app
You are a basketball coach and have recorded the basic information of your players in a Google Sheet (Excel). This includes their performance in various skill tests (e.g., shuttle run, standing long jump, running jump reach), physical information, and training suggestions. We share the data through Google Sheets and develop a webpage to display this content (similar to the player ability pages in Football Manager). You can get a visual understanding from the page below : [Display the radar chart using the Chart.js charting tool](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/samples/other-charts/radar.html).  

Refer to the training plan(The traditional approach involves teaching skills first, followed by teaching their application):  
|  Sequence| Course Title  | Duration |  Description | 
|  ----  | ----  |  ----  |  ----  |
| 1 | basic |60+30 |Project Introduction; Environment Setup; Basic Syntax |
| 2 | Basic Page Layout |60+30 | Learn how to display content in different areas and complete basic layout design |
| 3 | Drawing Charts |60+30 | Learn to use charting tools to draw different types of charts |
| 4 | Reading Data |60+30 | Learn how to share data using Google Sheets and how to read data in a program |  
| 5 | Integrate AI |60+30 | Include AI-generated evaluations and improvement suggestions for players |  

Students who complete the above courses are expected to have:
1. Basic concepts of web development;
2. Experience in how information technology can help us;
3. The ability to quickly start implementing their ideas;
4. Basic experience in using AI technology.
5. This case also has some practical significance, as there are data analysts in Wellington whose job involves data visualization. Charts are the foundation of visualization.
  
It can be divided into multiple sessions or take another form, such as a one-day or half-day boot camp, with the plan to complete the task in that time (the above courses are sufficient for the children to complete in half a day).   
Try to summarize, We have three teaching methods:  
1. Teach principles and knowledge first, then apply them.
2. Demonstrate the complete process for children to follow.
3. Use tools like ChatGPT to help children with programming and provide guidance.

  
## case 2 : game
For example, we can ask ChatGPT :  
```
What are some JavaScript games suitable for kids to learn programming, organized in a table by game name, objective, difficulty level, and learning points?
```
ChatGPT provided some results. My suggestion is to start with a text adventure game. It easily integrates with Google Sheets and AI, and once the template is developed, kids can use it to design many games on their own. Here are some beginner tutorials on YouTube :  
* [Build A Text Adventure Game With JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1S_NhKkvGA)
* [Are You Retro Enough? Text Adventure Engine Rebuilt in React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8_UnTnrn_g)

List of Teaching Tools Planned for Use :  
* [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) - Use online development tools to avoid the hassle of local environment setup.
* [chartjs](https://www.chartjs.org/) - Simple tools for create web chart
