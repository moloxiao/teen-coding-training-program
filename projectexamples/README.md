# Project Examples

## 1 Seatoun Memory Benches
In Seatoun, there are lots of benches, and each one has special words about someone remembered on it.  
We can make a website to show these words and also a map to show where each bench is. That way, everyone can see the special words and know where the benches are!

## 2 Google Assistant(Google Home)
